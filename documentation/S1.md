## 1. What is .NET?

> 1. .NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
> 1. With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.
> 1. .NET is supported by Microsoft. Microsoft ships official releases that are built and tested on Microsoft-maintained servers in Azure and supported just like any Microsoft product.

## 2. .NET History

### 2.1. .NET Framework

> 1. Discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#)

### 2.2. .NET Core 1.0 to 3.1, and .NET 5/6/7/8 and above

> 1. Discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET)
> 1. .NET includes a cross-platform implementation of the CLR known as CoreCLR and a streamlined BCL known as CoreFX.
> 1. Releases Long Term Support (LTS), Standard Term Support (STS)

## 3. 30,000 foot view of Common Language Runtime (CLR)

> 1. CLR is the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework and is responsible for managing the execution of .NET programs.
> 1. It provides core services such as memory management, thread management, and remoting, while also enforcing strict type safety and other forms of code accuracy that promote security and robustness.
> 1. It is a common language runtime that can be used by many programming languages, such as C#, F#, and Visual Basic.

## 4. C# Language

> 1. C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.
> 1. Program class is the entry point for every C# application and is required for every C# application.
> 1. C# is case sensitive. (C# is case sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently.)
> 1. The Main method is the entry point of a C# application. (There can only be one entry point in a C# program.)
> 1. Code Indentation is not required in C#. But it is recommended to use proper indentation to make the code more readable.
> 1. .csproj file is the project file for C# projects. It contains all the information that's required to build your project.
> 1. .sln file is the solution file for Visual Studio. It contains information about one or more projects.
> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace.
> 1. They are supported in Program.cs file. It should be as part of entry point and one application should have only one entry point.
> 1. The dot operator (.) is used to access members of a namespace, type, or object.
> 1. Demos -> ProgramStructureDemo.csproj.

## X. Dotnet CLI Commands

```bash
dotnet --info

dotnet --list-sdks 

dotnet --list-runtimes 

dotnet new

dotnet new list

dotnet new --help
```

## X. Common our First C# Program

```bash
dotnet new console -o FirstCSharpProgram --use-program-main
```

### X.X. Few Terms

> 1. A namespace contains types like classes to group them together.
> 1. A class contains the members of an object, including methods.
> 1. A method contains statements that implement an action that an object can take.

## X. Exploring Program Structure

> 1. To be decided

## X. Exploring Project Structure

> 1. .csporj file
> 1. Program.cs file
> 1. obj folder - intermediate files
> 1. bin folder - output files

## X. Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)

> 1. CLI is an open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ISO and ECMA that describes executable code and a runtime environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures.

## Few Points

## Next Session

> 1. Top-level statements are statements that aren't inside any type or namespace. They can be used to declare variables and their types, define functions, and define classes.

## 1. Console Application with and without Top Level Statements

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### 1.1 Without Top Level Statements

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo1 --use-program-main
```

![Demo 1 |150x150](./images/1/demo1.PNG)

### 1.2. With Top Level Statements

> 1. Top level Statements, will create `Program` class, and `<Main>$()` method

```bash
dotnet new console -o demo2
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[CompilerGenerated]
internal class Program
{
    private static void <Main>$(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
